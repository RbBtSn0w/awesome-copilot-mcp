## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of this project seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please do **not** report it via a public issue. Instead, please follow these steps:

1. Send an email to [your-email@example.com](mailto:your-email@example.com) with the details of the vulnerability.
2. Include a description of the vulnerability, the potential impact, and steps to reproduce it.
3. We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a timeline for a fix.

Once a fix is prepared, we will release a new version and coordinate the announcement.

Thank you for helping keep this project secure!
